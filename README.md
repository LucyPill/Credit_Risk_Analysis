# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview/Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis is to use various machine learning models to predict credit card risk. We will resample the data and determine the model that better predict risk.

We will use:
* Random Oversampling 
* SMOTE
* ClusterCentroids
* SMOTEENN algorithms 
* Balanced Random Forest Classifier
* Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier

## Results:
### Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk

For all three algorithms, the following have been completed:
An accuracy score for the model is calculated (7.5 pt)
A confusion matrix has been generated (7.5 pt)
An imbalanced classification report has been generated (15 pt)
